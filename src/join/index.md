# Stay Updated

## UB Attending Students

UB ACM is free for all University at Buffalo students of any major. UB ACM's online community can be found in our Slack workspace. From the leadership, we make all of our announcements first in the Slack workspace. Sign up with your <em>@buffalo.edu</em> address.

To stay updated, we recommend downloading the Slack application and turn on important notifications. It is available as an app for all major platforms.
