    <h1 id="check-ins">Check-Ins</h1>
<p>UB ACM require everyone who attends our events to check in. As a University at Buffalo student organization, we are required to collect the <em>UBIT ID</em> of students who attend our events. For our club members&#39; convenience, we developed a sophisticated check-in system that allows members to effortlessly check in to our events.</p>
<p><a class="button button_primary" href="/checkins/list">List of Member Check-Ins</a>
<a class="button button_secondary" href="/checkins/raffle">Raffle</a></p>
<hr />

<h2 id="why-do-i-need-to-check-in-">Why do I need to check in?</h2>
<p>By checking in to our event, we can provide numbers to the two University at Buffalo entities we&#39;re housed under, the Student Association (SA) and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). These numbers are important to show that our events are in demand and in turn we can receive more support from the school.</p>
<p>As for members, for every check-in, we will provide <em>UB ACM check-in marks</em> (now referred to as Marks) weighted differently for events.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>1 Mark</em>: Weekly Meeting Events (workshops, tech talks, and social events)</li>
<li><em>2 Marks</em>: Hackathons and Hack Nights (UB Hacking, BrickHack, MHacks, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Other opportunities will award Marks based on the discretion of the UB ACM leadership.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting ACMs will allow members to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority food pickup at <a href="/hack">Hack Night</a>.</li>
<li>Priority registration at UB ACM social events.</li>
<li>End-of-year raffle tickets. <a href="/checkins/raffle">Learn more about the raffle here!</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><small>UB ACM leadership members cannot be rewarded with Marks and cannot benefit from Mark bonuses. Members who violate club rules are subject to have partial or all awarded Marks rescinded. Marks are not currency and have no monetary value.</small></p>

          We are UB ACM, University at Buffalo's undergraduate computer science organization. Our mission is to empower student peers and help them find their path in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          UB ACM hosts a variety of extracurricular events to achieve our goal. We have weekly meetings where our members or speakers run workshops and tech talks on the latest technologies used by professionals in industry or academia. Additionally, we run events like Hack Night and social events to allow students to connect with others with similar interests.
