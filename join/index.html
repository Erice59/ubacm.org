          We are UB ACM, University at Buffalo's undergraduate computer science organization. Our mission is to empower student peers and help them find their path in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          UB ACM hosts a variety of extracurricular events to achieve our goal. We have weekly meetings where our members or speakers run workshops and tech talks on the latest technologies used by professionals in industry or academia. Additionally, we run events like Hack Night and social events to allow students to connect with others with similar interests.
