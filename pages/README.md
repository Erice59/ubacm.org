# CHECK YOUR BRANCH BEFORE EDITING THE SITE

Hello! Welcome to UB ACM's club website repository. The website is implemented using Metalsmith, however the repository is set up a little untraditionally.

## When you're making an update to the website, make sure you make changes to the `dev` branch.

GitHub pages are not recognizing the `gh-pages` branch when Travis CI is pushing to it, so we're forced to set up the `master` branch as the live site branch.
