## Workshops
Our workshops are informative introductory workshops ran mostly by upperclassmen with expertise in the topics. We host workshops that cover a wide range of technologies used by professionals in industry or academia. We've covered Python, JavaScript, Docker, web development, and much more.

## Tech Talks
We bring university professors and industry speakers to our school and present interesting technologies. We've hosted professional speakers from local and major tech companies like Cisco, Thimble, and Microsoft to present our our school.

## Hack Night co-hosted by ACV Auctions
Build awesome projects, do homework, or just hang out with your fellow peers at Hack Night! Our Hack Night event series are recurring Saturday events at University at Buffalo where students gather and work together in Davis 101. The event is sponsored by reputable companies from Buffalo and major tech hub.

## Social Events
We organize our own social events like board game nights and barbecue socials to let students network. We also help companies like Bloomberg organize for company-sponosred social events with students.
